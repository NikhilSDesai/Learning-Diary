In the field of earth observation, the term "correction" describes the process of removing or reducing the effects of various factors distort the imagery or data. These factors can include atmospheric effects, sensor noise, and other sources of error. 

There are four main correction types:

- **Geometric** Adjusts for image distortions due to the Earth's rotation, sensor tilt, and curvature, ensuring accurate spatial positioning.

- **Atmospheric** Removes the effects of atmospheric gases and particles on the recorded signal to accurately reflect the Earth's surface reflectance.

- **Topographic**: Corrects for terrain-induced distortions in satellite images, aligning them with true geographic locations based on elevation data.

- **Radiometric** Adjusts the digital image data to correct for sensor noise and inconsistencies, ensuring uniform brightness and contrast across the image.
