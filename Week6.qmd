# Google Earth Engine

## Summary

Sorry in advance for the length of this entry, Google Earth Engine (GEE) is an amazing tool and conducting analysis on my hometown was a treat

This week we learned the basics of GEE - It is an amazing tool. It allows users to sidestep the labourious process of downloading and processing satellite imagery. Instead, users can access and analyse earth observation data directly in the cloud. GEE makes dealing with remote sensing data incredibly simple.

This week's lecture started with a slide which illustrated the exponential uptake of GEE, showing the number of academic publications using GEE since 2015. GEE's uptake is seen below [@pham2023]:

```

Unlike traditional tools such as SNAP or QGIS, GEE operates in the cloud, providing users with immediate access to its extensive data archives and powerful computing resources. This means users can run complex analyses and algorithms on massive datasets directly within their web browser, without the need for extensive local storage or high computing power.

The key features of GEE:

**Data Catalog**: Google Earth Engine provides access to a diverse and continuously expanding catalog of satellite imagery datasets

**Analysis Tools**: It offers a set of tools and algorithms for processing and analysing geospatial data (image classification, time-series analysis, object detection, change detection etc.)

**Code Editor**: The Earth Engine Code Editor provides an interactive development environment where users can write, test and run geospatial analysis code

**Visualisation**: GEE allows users to visualise geospatial data and analysis results in interactive maps. A user can explore and interact with the data layers.

Below I've used GEE to conduct a few analyses using methods we've learned about over the past few weeks. I've used Vancouver as a case study here. I thought it would interesting to see how its distinctly north american 'grid system' would appear.

## Applications 1

### NDVI Analysis

NDVI Analysis assesses vegetation health and coverage in a given area. By comparing the reflectance of near-infrared and red light, NDVI helps to distinguish between vegetated and non-vegetated surfaces, indicating plant health and biomass. High indexes are seen in Stanley park, the large green area seen at the top of the window and on the left tip of the city is the *University Endowment Lands,* an old growth protected area where the University of British Columbia is located. Due to housing shortages in the city, several acres of this protected area have sadly been approved for development. I will be checking to see how this area changes over the next few years.

### PCA

In essence, Principal Component Analysis is used to emphasise variation and bring out patterns in a dataset. In remote sensing, PCA transforms correlated bands in an image into uncorrelated variables or principal components. This method is useful for enhancing the differences of satellite imagery while retaining most of the original information "...often revealing hidden patterns in the data."

```

### Texture Analysis

Finally *Texture Analysis* involves evaluating the spatial arrangement of colors or intensities in an image to identify patterns or structures. By applying methods such as GLCM, texture analysis can highlight areas of contrast or uniformity which can provide insights about the physical characteristics and differences of the surface. This technique is useful for things like classifying land cover, detecting change and understanding the structure features in the landscape.

## Applications 2

I watched Noah Gorelick's [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvaBZbph_cU&t=1822s) on machine learning in GEE. As a result I ended up diving into another one of his papers, [Google Earth Engine: Planetary-scale geospatial analysis for everyone](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302900), published in 2017. Gorelick mentions a plethora of different ways you can leverage GEE for analysis, some of those include:

1.  **Global Forest Change Monitoring**: GEE has been used to characterise global forest extent, loss and gain using decision trees and large collections of Landsat scenes
2.  **Water Resources Management**: GEE enables the detailed monitoring of water bodies' extent, health, and surface water changes globally
3.  **Agricultural Monitoring and Yield Estimation**: Leveraging GEE for agricultural monitoring, specifically for estimating crop yields by relating output from crop model simulations
4.  **Urban Expansion and Land Use Change Detection**: The platform supports the analysis of urban expansion and land use changes

The real strength/utility of GEE is in the speed it can analyse data. This means you can look at much bigger areas and do more studies than before. To me, this seems like a big deal for studying the environment because it helps us understand and make decisions faster.

A tangible example of the strength and utility of GEE is its role in the Global Forest Watch initiative. This platform uses GEE to monitor deforestation around the world in near-real-time. Traditionally, analysing satellite images to detect changes in forest cover over vast areas like the Amazon rainforest would take months.

## Reflections

GEE offers a wide range of applications that span from environmental monitoring to urban planning and agricultural management. Its vast repository of satellite imagery and geospatial data allows for real-time environmental monitoring, making it indispensable tool up-to-date geographical information to make informed decisions. For instance, in agriculture, GEE enables the analysis of crop health over vast areas, aiding in the efficient management of resources and ultimately leading to increased productivity and reduced costs.

From a user experience standpoint, GEE is very mature. Its interface is both intuitive and user-friendly. The platform's ability to handle large datasets and perform complex spatial analyses in the cloud, without the need for powerful local computing resources, is particularly impressive. The main thing I noticed when conducting analysis using it vs SNAP or QGIS is just this. It's easy, fast and vast. I don't know enough about remote sensing to assert that GEE enables *new* types of analysis. However, through readings, it is obvious that GEE enables more breadth and depth of RS & EO analysis.

GEE is probably the most complex tool I've learned to use on this course thus far. Having taken a sneak peak of next week's content, I'm excited expand my understanding of the tool by using more complex methods.
