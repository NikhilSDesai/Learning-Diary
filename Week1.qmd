# Introduction to Remote Sensing

## Summary

Remote Sensing is a subset of Geographic Information Systems. It is the science of collecting & analysing information about the earth's surface through the use of sensors mounted on satellites or planes [@Olsen2007].

The value of Remote Sensing spans various fields. It provides critical data for environmental monitoring, disaster management and urban development to name a few [@Cracknell2018]. This week we learned about basic concepts in remote sensing and conducted some rudimentary analysis in R and SNAP (a QGIS for remote sensing data). Below I'll provide an overview of the technology, its applications and my reflections on the potential of remote sensing.

We were introduced to two satellite programmes this week: *Landsat* and *Sentinel*. Sentinel-2 data offers a spatial resolution of 10 meters compared to Landsat's 30 meters creating more detailed observations. Sentinel-2 satellite orbit every 5 days and offer more frequent updates than Landsat's 16-day cycle. This makes Sentinel-2 particularly valuable for monitoring fast-changing conditions on the Earthâ€™s surface [@Claverie2018]. For example the [Dynamic World](https://dynamicworld.app/) programme is a near real-time land cover dataset that uses satellites to monitor changes in Earth's surface.

### There are two types of sensors: Active & Passive

-   **Active sensors** emit energy in the form of radiation, then detect and measure the radiation that is *back scattered* or reflected back up to the satellite. An example is SAR [@Kreucher2005].

-   **Passive sensors** measure natural energy reflected or emitted from Earth, without *actively* emitting any signal of their own [@Liu2013]. An example is the Landsat programme, which captures the Earth's surface in the visible, near-infrared and thermal infrared wavelengths. This is illustrated below:

### How Remote Sensors Store Data

Remote sensing technology captures data about Earth's surface and atmosphere by detecting electromagnetic signatures, which are distinct patterns of energy radiated or reflected [@NASA2024].

Data from remote sensing are stored with attention to different types of resolution. Each provides unique insights into the Earth's physical characteristics.

-   **Spatial resolution** indicates the smallest visible feature in an image. Higher resolution reveals finer details

-   **Spectral resolution** is a sensor's ability to distinguish light wavelengths, critical for identifying materials

-   **Temporal resolution** measures how often an area is imaged, important for tracking changes over time

-   **Radiometric resolution** reflects a sensor's sensitivity to light intensity, aiding in detecting subtle variations

### Raster Analysis: Kamloops, BC, Canada Sentinel-2 Imagery

Before diving into case studies using remote sensing data, I wanted to showcase some basic analysis you can conduct. I've downloaded some satelite data of my Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. Below is a True Colour Images of the area (built from the Blue, Green and Red Bands)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="Kamloops, British Columbia, Spectral Signature"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/TCIKamloops.jpeg")
```

After experimenting in QGIS, I extracted the spectral signature alongside some indices of the area. The spectral signature is a a unique combination of reflectance values across red, green, and blue wavelengths. This enables the identification of specific materials or objects on Earth by their color profile

Below is the Spectral Signature and Terrain Ruggedness Index of the imagery:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="Kamloops, British Columbia, Spectral Signature"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/spectralsignature.png")
```

The Terrain Ruggedness Index quantifies the topographic variation of an area in Earth observation data, measuring the difference in elevation between adjacent pixels to assess the roughness of the terrain [@Valentine2005].

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="Kamloops, British Columbia, Terrain Ruggedness Index"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/terrainruggednessindex.png")
```

Here, I have built a true-colour composite from the red, green, and blue bands of the Sentinel-2 imagery. True-color composite images depict the Earth's surface in colors similar to those a human eye would perceive, combining red, green, and blue light wavelengths to create natural-looking photographs from satellite data [@Sovdat2019].

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.cap="Kamloops, British Columbia, True Colour Composite"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/TCCKamloops.png")
```

## Applications

Remote sensing gives us a way to see and understand changes on our planet that we can't detect from the ground. My initial perspective was that remote sensing data was mainly used for analysis of natural phenomena and climate related. After doing some reading, it as evident the applications of remote sensing are vast. Below, I've described two interesting case studies I came across.

### Tracking the Growth of Refugee Camps

Sentinel-2 imagery, humanitarian organisations mapped the rapid expansion of Rohingya refugee camps, facilitating efficient aid distribution, infrastructure planning, and risk management. This data was instrumental in adapting emergency responses and optimising resource allocation as the camp situation evolved [@Braun2019].

### Investigating the Suez Canal Blockage by the *Ever Given*

Sentinel-2 images provided clear views of the ship's position and the traffic jam of vessels waiting to pass through the canal. These images were crucial for assessing the blockage and its impact on global trade [@Niroumand-Jadidi2021]

## Reflections

The potential of remote sensing to explore humanitarian issues was very eye opening to me, especially after reading a CASA staff member's (Ollie Ballinger) contributions to Bellingcat, an investigative news outlet which specialises in disaster and war crimes. This technology's utility extends beyond monitoring natural events to human-related issues, including human rights abuses, war crimes and informal settlements.

This technology was deeply fascinating to me from an academic and commercial perspective. From an academic perspective, the concept of extracting immense amounts of data from imagery is will make me look at photos very differently. Analysis as simple as extracting spectral signatures can provide a wealth of information about the land cover and terrain of an area. Spectral signatures are like fingerprints for different land cover. This capability is crucial for environmental monitoring, a particular interest of mine.

After reading about the applications of Remote Sensing, it is clear that its potential has not been completely tapped into. The field is still in its early stages only from a commercial perspective. I say this because I primarily found application within academic and research settings. The processing of Satelite Imagery prior to Google Earth Engine, as I found out this week, is slow and tedious. GEE was only release to the public in 2010. This gap between academic research and commercial application presents a vast opportunity for innovation and implementation in various industries.

This week has been a great intro to Remote Sensing and has whet my appetite for the coming weeks.
