# About Me {.unnumbered}

My name is Nikhil Desai, I am originally from British Columbia, Canada. I completed my undergraduate MA in Economics from the University of Edinburgh, then worked as a management consultant for 3 years. I left this role and am now pursing an MSc in Urban Spatial Science at The Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis. I've been lucky to have lived in a variety of cities in Canada, The Netherlands, New Zealand and now the UK. I think this has caused me to pay attention to the built environment and how it shapes our lives and changes over time.

On this site, you will find my week-by-week reflections on my Remote Sensing & Earth Observation course. I am very interested in the intersection of climate change and remote sensing, particularly in relation to deforestation and wildfires. Since 2017, wildfires in British Columbia have been the worst in the province's history, burning over 1.2 million hectares of land. The 2018 fires were so severe that the smoke from the fires was visible from space as seen below.

I'm looking forward to look at some ideas and concepts I am passionate about with a new lens.
